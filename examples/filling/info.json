The item on the left shows a pink pig, while the framed image on the right is missing the lower-right corner, specifically the front feet of the pig. By examining the four available puzzle pieces, it's sure that piece C matches the missing feet. In addition to shape, the color of the piece further confirms that piece C is correct, as its color matches that of the target image, unlike the other options. So the action you should choose is C: 'place piece in backpack C at grid I'."
