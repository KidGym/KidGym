The framed image on the right is missing the upper-left corner, specifically a left triangle with a right Angle vertex in the upper right corner. By examining the four available puzzle pieces, we can determine that piece C matches the missing feet. So the action you should choose is C: 'place piece in backpack C at grid I'."
